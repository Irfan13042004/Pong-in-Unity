# Pong-in-Unity
Pong is a simple and the first computer game created in 1972 and I tried to recreate that in unity. These are the C# scripts that are used in the Engine. This is a simple version with limited feature


If you get any NullReference Exception or any other Reference based error check whether the script is catched or referenced correctly. Also chech in the engine whether all the public members and SerializedField are setted properly.
